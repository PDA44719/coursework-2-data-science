## Explanation of Requirements Identification Methods
The key aspect to be considered for selecting a requirements' identification method is the nature of the project. As was
mentioned in coursework 1: “This project comes from the students' own initiative and will be completed by them”.
Therefore, our team is expected to work in a relatively independent manner from the target users.

Methods like interviewing or doing workshops with film producers would be very beneficial, but they would only be
realistic if our team were being funded by film production companies. Otherwise, it is unlikely that producers would be
interested in participating, as they would be required to have an active role in the process.

On the other hand, there are other options like observing the work environment of the users or creating different
prototypes of the app and receiving feedback on them. While these are options that require a more passive involvement
on the film producers’ part, they are still unsuitable due to the considerable amount of time the users would need to
be helping us.

Hence, a reasonable to use would be conducting a survey to have a clearer understanding of the user needs and
expectations. Surveys are generally short, and people are more likely to not feel that they cause a significant
disruption to their work. This method could be used if the project were “real”. However, questionnaires require ethics
approval from UCL, so they cannot be used. Another method that could be used if this was a real-life project are focus
groups. They are a variation of brainstorming that is more structured and is carried out in groups of around 6 to 12
participants. Nevertheless, as this coursework is individual, focus groups will not be utilized.

Lastly, the methods that will be used are brainstorming and interface analysis. The brainstorming session will be
focused on creating user stories that emulate how the target users might think. Additionally, with the aid of the
context diagram, an interface analysis will be carried out to understand how the different components of the solution
interact.
