After eliciting the requirements, they must be ranked. There are different methods for doing so. Some of those methods
require collaboration (multiple people involved in the prioritization) and others can be performed by just one person.

As previously stated, this coursework is individual, which means that there are limitations when it comes to the methods
that could reasonably be utilized. Nevertheless, for the purpose of researching, some collaborative methods will be
discussed too.

If a team were working on this project, priority poker would be ideal. In this method, each team member is given a set
of cards, each of which having a different priority level (which range from very high to very low, there could even be
an insufficient information option). Once the cards have been dealt, one of the user stories would be shown and each
person would choose one of the cards. Then, all the chosen cards are revealed at the same time, and a discussion would
be carried out where the members would explain their reasoning behind choosing their cards and collectively decide what
the priority level should be for the specific story. The process would then be repeated for each of the stories [1]. 

Another possibility for team projects is the 100 points method, that consists of giving each team member 100 points that
they can distribute between the different user stories depending on the priority level they think each story should
have, and then the number of points each story received is used to prioritize the stories [2]. However, this method
would not be my first choice, as it is not geared towards open discussion like priority poker is.

Let’s move on to less complex methods that can be easily used by one person. One of the most commonly used ones is
MoSCoW, which requires the user stories to be categorized into: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have. This
method can be great when dealing with a large set of requirements. Nevertheless, for this coursework we are focusing on
the main requirements, so most of them would be Must have or Should have, which would not create much distinction
between them.
